I have these projects using Power BI. The first project involves working with a large dataset about a survey of data professionals. My aim was to visualize this data and make it into easily understandable insights. I have converted the Power BI file into PDF format.
In the second project I am using a Bike Sales dataset, my aim is to see the trends and the product performance.
