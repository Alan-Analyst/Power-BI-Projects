# MS PowerBI Projects

## Survery of data Professionals

I have created these projects using Power BI. The first project involves working with a large dataset about a survey of data professionals. My aim was to visualize this data 
and make it into easily understandable insights. I have converted the Power BI file into PDF format.

## Bike Sales 
In the second project I am using a Bike Sales dataset, my aim is to see the trends and the product performance.
